# Shakes-and-Fidget-Damage-Calculator

The calculator can calculate the damage for every class.  
It is not 100% correct because values could be rounded differently by Shakes & Fidget.   But the calculator matches most of the time really close to the actual value.  

You have to have Python installed if you want to use the .pyw. You can download [Python](https://www.python.org/) from https://www.python.org/.  
Python 3.9.2 is recommended. You need to install ttkthemes after you installed Python by going to your console and wirte pip install ttkthemes.

You can [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16LoEGsLwutlf5IRV0P_zgGbNwkL1wZYG/view?usp=sharing) a .exe from https://drive.google.com/file/d/16LoEGsLwutlf5IRV0P_zgGbNwkL1wZYG/view?usp=sharing.  
With the .exe you don't need Python installed or any librarrys.

### Usage
- Make sure you have Python correctly installed and ttkthemes
- Or make sure to have the .exe downloaded
- It takes some time to start so be patiently
- Double click the downloaded .pyw file or the .exe and enter your values. Don't forget to add the gems values on your normal values.
